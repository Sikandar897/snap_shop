# SnapShop - Full-Stack E-commerce App

Welcome to SnapShop, a fully-featured, scalable e-commerce application built with Node.js and MongoDB. This project is a continuation of my previous app, Mystic Mall, which was built using Firebase. However, this time, I’ve taken a more advanced approach by developing the backend with Node.js and MongoDB, pushing further into full-stack development.

## Exciting News!
As I advance my journey in full-stack development, I’m excited to share this project with you! **SnapShop** is designed to be a **huge industrial-level application**, complete with all modern e-commerce functionalities and following **SOLID principles** to ensure clean and maintainable code.

# Tech Stack
## Frontend
1. **Flutter:** The frontend is built with Flutter, making the app responsive and accessible across all platforms (iOS, Android, Web).
2. **Provider:** Used for state management following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for clean separation of logic and UI.

## Backend
1. **Node.js:** The backend is powered by Node.js for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
2. **Express.js:** To handle routing and RESTful API integration.
3. **MongoDB:** The database layer, providing flexibility and scalability for handling large sets of data.

## Features
**SnapShop** is packed with rich features designed to offer the best shopping experience:
1. **Add to Cart:** Easily add, update, and remove products in the cart.
2. **Payment Integration:** Seamless integration with popular payment gateways for secure checkouts.
3. **Push Notifications:** Get notified about your orders, discounts, and offers.
4. **Order Tracking:** Stay updated with real-time tracking of orders.
5. **Social Media Integration:** Log in and share via Facebook, Google, and more.
6. **REST API Integration:** Powered by custom-built Node.js APIs that follow a clean architecture approach.
7. **SOLID Principles:** The codebase strictly follows SOLID design principles for maintainability.
**Customizability:** You can request personalized features or adjustments to fit your business needs.

## Future Enhancements
As the project evolves, I plan to add more advanced features, such as:
1. **Advanced Product Recommendations**
2. **User Reviews & Ratings**
3. **Admin Dashboard**
4. **Analytics Integration**
5. **Wishlist Feature**
6. **Multi-Language Support**

## Architecture
I am following **Clean Architecture (MVVM)** on the frontend and applying best practices to the backend **using Node.js**. The app’s architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and easy integration of new features.
